## What is Drone?

Drone is a continuous delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML build file to define and execute build pipelines inside Docker containers.

## Contributing To Drone

Drone's codebase is opensource and any kind of contribution is highly encouraged. Here are some resources to get you stsrted

### Release Procedure:

  Run the changelog generator.

  ```BASH
  docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src/your-app githubchangeloggenerator/github-changelog-generator -u drone -p drone -t <secret github token>
  ```

  You can generate a token by logging into your GitHub account and going to Settings -> Personal access tokens.

  Next we tag the PR's with the fixes or enhancements labels. If the PR does not fulfill the requirements, do not add a label.

  _Before moving on make sure to update the version file_ `version/version.go && version/version_test.go`.

  Run the changelog generator again with the future version according to semver.

  ```BASH
  docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src/your-app githubchangeloggenerator/github-changelog-generator -u harness -p drone -t <secret token> --future-release v1.0.0
  ```

### Example `.drone.yml` build file

This build file contains a single pipeline (you can have multiple pipelines too) that builds a go application. The front end with npm. Publishes the docker container to a registry and announces the results to a slack room.

```YAML
name: default

kind: pipeline
type: docker

steps:
- name: backend
  image: golang
  commands:
    - go get
    - go build
    - go test

- name: frontend
  image: node:6
  commands:
    - npm install
    - npm test

- name: publish
  image: plugins/docker
  settings:
    repo: octocat/hello-world
    tags: [ 1, 1.1, latest ]
    registry: index.docker.io

- name: notify
  image: plugins/slack
  settings:
    channel: developers
    username: drone
```
